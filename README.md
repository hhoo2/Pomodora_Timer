This is a Python-based Pomodoro Timer with a graphical user interface using Tkinter. The Pomodoro technique is a popular time management method that encourages users to work in focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks (usually 5 minutes) to boost productivity.

## Features

- **Simple Interface:** The Pomodoro timer provides a user-friendly interface with start and reset buttons, making it easy to control your work and break sessions.

- **Visual Cues:** The timer uses colors to indicate work and break phases, ensuring that you can visually distinguish between the two.

- **Countdown Timer:** The countdown timer dynamically displays the remaining time, helping you stay on track during your work or break intervals.

- **Session Tracking:** The code keeps track of completed work sessions and displays them as checkmarks, giving you a sense of accomplishment and productivity.
